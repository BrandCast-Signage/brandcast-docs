# Playlists

Playlists are the engine of your digital signage. They allow you to sequence multiple **Layouts** to play in a loop.

:::info Core Concept
**Playlists contain Layouts, not raw files.**
If you want to add an image to a playlist, you must first create a Layout that contains that image (or use the Quick Start Wizard which does this for you).

## Creating a Playlist
1.  Navigate to **Playlists** in the sidebar.
2.  Click **Create Playlist**.
3.  **Playlist Settings:**
    *   **Name:** e.g., "Lunch Rotation".
    *   **Default Duration:** How long each item plays by default (e.g., 30 seconds).
    *   **Transition:** Choose "Fade", "Slide", or "None".
4.  Click **Create**.

## Managing Items

### Adding Layouts
1.  Inside the Playlist Editor, look for the **Items** section (or click the "Playlist Play" icon to view items).
2.  Select a **Layout** from the dropdown list.
3.  **Duration (Optional):** You can override the default duration for this specific item.
    *   *Example:* Set your "Special Offer" layout to 15 seconds, while everything else plays for 30.
4.  Click **Add**.

### Reordering
*   **Drag and Drop:** Grab the handle on the left of any item to rearrange the sequence.
*   The order updates immediately on your displays once saved.

## Assigning a Playlist
To make a playlist live, you must assign it to a Display.

1.  Navigate to **Displays**.
2.  Select your target display.
3.  In the **Active Content** section, select your Playlist.
4.  Click **Update**.

## Common Strategies

### The "Dayparting" Loop
Create different playlists for different times of day (used with **Schedules**):
*   **Morning Playlist:** Breakfast Menu, Coffee Specials, Morning News.
*   **Afternoon Playlist:** Lunch Menu, Happy Hour Teaser.

### The "Manager's Special"
Keep a short playlist (e.g., 3 items) active on your primary screens. When you need to update a price, you only edit the *Layout*, and the Playlist (and all screens) update automatically.
