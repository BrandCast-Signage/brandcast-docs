# Playlists

Rotate multiple layouts automatically on your displays with playlists for dynamic, engaging content.

## What are Playlists?

Playlists allow you to show multiple layouts in sequence on a single display. Each layout appears for a set duration before automatically transitioning to the next, creating a dynamic slideshow effect.

**Use Cases:**
- Rotate between product categories
- Show promotions, then announcements, then social feeds
- Display morning content, then switch to afternoon content
- Alternate between different information types

## Playlists vs. Schedules

**Playlists:**
- Continuous rotation of layouts
- Fixed order (Layout A → B → C → repeat)
- Each layout has duration
- Always running

**Schedules:**
- Time-based layout switching
- Different content at different times
- Rule-based (9am: Layout A, 12pm: Layout B)
- More complex control

**Use Both Together:**
- Schedule controls WHICH playlist plays WHEN
- Playlist controls HOW layouts rotate WITHIN that time
- Example: Morning playlist 8am-12pm, Afternoon playlist 12pm-5pm

## Creating a Playlist

### Step 1: Create Playlist

1. Navigate to **Content** → **Playlists**
2. Click **Create Playlist**
3. Enter details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Product Showcase Rotation")
   - **Description**: Optional notes about purpose
   - **Store**: Which store/location this applies to

### Step 2: Add Layouts

1. Click **Add Layout** in playlist editor
2. Select layout from dropdown
3. Configure:
   - **Duration**: How long this layout displays (seconds)
   - **Order**: Position in rotation sequence
4. Repeat for additional layouts

**Minimum:** 2 layouts required
**Maximum:** No limit, but 3-8 layouts typical

### Step 3: Configure Transitions

**Transition Style:**
- **Fade**: Smooth crossfade between layouts (recommended)
- **Slide Left**: Layouts slide from right to left
- **Slide Right**: Layouts slide from left to right
- **Slide Up**: Layouts slide from bottom to top
- **Slide Down**: Layouts slide from top to bottom
- **None**: Instant cut (fastest, but abrupt)

**Transition Speed:**
- **Fast**: 0.3 seconds
- **Medium**: 0.6 seconds (recommended)
- **Slow**: 1.0 seconds

### Step 4: Set Default Duration

**What It Does:**
- Applied to all layouts that don't have custom duration
- Simplifies setup when most layouts should display same time
- Individual layouts can override

**Recommended Durations:**
- **15-20 seconds**: Quick rotation, high engagement
- **30 seconds**: Standard (most common)
- **45-60 seconds**: Detailed content, slower pace
- **2-3 minutes**: Complex information, minimal rotation

### Step 5: Activate Playlist

1. Toggle **Active** switch to ON
2. Click **Save Playlist**
3. Assign to display(s)

**Inactive Playlists:**
- Saved but not running
- Useful for seasonal content
- Can activate/deactivate anytime

## Assigning Playlists to Displays

### Method 1: From Display Settings

1. Go to **Displays** → Select display
2. **Content Assignment** section
3. **Playlist** dropdown → Select playlist
4. Click **Save**

**Result:** Display immediately starts rotating through playlist layouts

### Method 2: From Playlist Editor

1. Edit playlist
2. **Assigned Displays** section
3. Check displays that should use this playlist
4. Click **Save**

**Result:** Selected displays switch to this playlist

### Multiple Displays

**Same Playlist:**
- Multiple displays can use same playlist
- Synchronized rotation (start at same time)
- Or independent (each starts when assigned)

**Different Playlists:**
- Each display can have unique playlist
- Different content per location
- Mix and match as needed

## Managing Playlist Content

5. Edit as needed

**Result:** Copy of playlist with all layouts and settings

## Advanced Playlist Features

### Weighted Rotation

**What It Does:**
- Some layouts appear more frequently than others
- Based on duration (longer = more impressions)
- Or explicit weight setting

**Example:**
```
Layout A: 30 seconds (1x weight)
Layout B: 60 seconds (2x weight) ← Appears twice as often
Layout C: 30 seconds (1x weight)

Rotation: A → B → C → B → A → B → C → B (repeats)
```

**Setup:**
1. Edit playlist
2. Enable **Weighted Rotation**
3. Set weight per layout (1-10)
4. Higher weight = more frequent appearance

### Dynamic Playlists

**Content-Based Rotation:**
- Layouts automatically added based on rules
- Example: "All promotions" playlist includes any layout tagged "promotion"
- Updates when new layouts created

**Setup:**
1. Enable **Dynamic Playlist**
2. Set filtering rules:
   - Tag-based
   - Date-based (layouts valid today)
   - Content type-based
3. Save

**Benefit:** Playlists update automatically, no manual management

### Playlist Scheduling

**Combine with Schedules:**
- Different playlists at different times
- Example:
  - Breakfast Playlist: 6am-11am
  - Lunch Playlist: 11am-2pm
  - Dinner Playlist: 2pm-10pm

**Setup:**
1. Create schedule (see [Schedules documentation](./schedules.md))
2. Add rules with playlists as target
3. Assign schedule to display

### Conditional Playlists

**Rules-Based Activation:**
- Weather-based: Rain playlist vs. Sunny playlist
- Stock level-based: Low stock highlights
- Time-sensitive: Flash sale playlist

**Requires:** Professional plan, rule engine setup

## Best Practices

### Playlist Design

**Layout Count:**
- **2-3 layouts**: Simple rotation, easy to follow
- **4-6 layouts**: Standard, good variety
- **7-10 layouts**: High variety, longer cycle
- **10+ layouts**: Consider splitting into multiple playlists

**Total Cycle Time:**
- Calculate: Sum of all layout durations = one complete cycle
- Recommended: 2-5 minutes per cycle
- Too short (&lt;1 min): Disorienting
- Too long (&gt;10 min): May miss content

**Content Variety:**
- Mix content types (promos, info, social, etc.)
- Avoid repetitive layouts
- Balance text-heavy and visual layouts
- Keep pacing interesting

### Duration Guidelines

**Content Type Recommendations:**
- **Images/Photos**: 10-15 seconds
- **Simple Text**: 15-20 seconds
- **Detailed Information**: 30-45 seconds
- **Complex Data/Charts**: 45-60 seconds
- **Video Layouts**: Duration of video + 5 seconds
- **Interactive Content**: 60+ seconds

**Reading Time Formula:**
- Count words on layout
- Average reading speed: 200-250 words/minute
- Add 5-10 seconds buffer
- Example: 50 words = 12-15 seconds minimum

**Adjust for Audience:**
- Retail (quick browsing): Shorter durations
- Waiting areas: Longer durations
- Employee break rooms: Longer durations
- High-traffic areas: Shorter durations

### Transition Selection

**Fade (Recommended):**
- Professional appearance
- Works with all content types
- No jarring motion
- Universal choice

**Slide Transitions:**
- More dynamic
- Good for sequential content (step 1 → step 2)
- Can be distracting if overused
- Match slide direction to content flow

**None (Instant Cut):**
- Use sparingly
- Best for very similar layouts
- News/stock ticker style
- When speed matters most

### Performance Optimization

**Layout Complexity:**
- Simpler layouts transition faster
- Heavy layouts may cause lag
- Optimize images (compress, resize)
- Limit simultaneous animations

**Caching:**
- Playlists pre-load next layout
- Ensures smooth transitions
- More layouts = more memory usage
- Keep playlist size reasonable (&lt;15 layouts)

**Network Considerations:**
- Content-heavy playlists need good bandwidth
- Video in playlists especially demanding
- Test on actual display hardware
- Consider lower-res content for slower connections
