# Google Photos Integration

Import images and videos from your Google Photos albums into your Media Library.

**Type:** Library Import

## Overview
Unlike live integrations that stream content, Google Photos acts as a **Library Import** source. You connect your account to fetch assets into your Media Library, where they can be used in any Image or Video layout area.

## Connection
1.  Go to **Integrations** > **Google Photos**.
2.  Click **Connect Account**.
3.  Authorize BrandCast to access your photos.

## Usage
1.  **Import:** Browse your Google Photos albums and select images/videos to import.
2.  **Library:** Imported assets appear in your **Media Library** with a 'google-photos' tag.
3.  **Display:** Use these assets in any Slideshow or Image widget in your layouts.
