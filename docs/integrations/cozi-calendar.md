# Cozi Calendar Integration

Sync your Cozi family calendar to your BrandCast displays.

## Overview

The Cozi Calendar integration uses the iCal standard to bring your family's schedule to your digital signage. By creating **Cozi Content Sources**, you can display color-coded family events on any screen in your home or office.

**Key Features:**
- **Family Color Coding:** Preserves the color coding for each family member (if supported by the feed).
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes in the Cozi app sync to the display automatically.

## 1. Connect the Integration

1.  Log in to **Cozi.com** (desktop version).
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Calendar**.
3.  Locate the **Shared iCal URL** and copy it.
4.  In BrandCast, navigate to **Integrations** > **Cozi Calendar** (or use the generic **iCal** integration).

## 2. Create a Content Source

A **Content Source** is a configured instance of your family calendar.

1.  Navigate to **Integrations** > **Cozi Calendar**.
2.  Click **Create New Source**.
3.  **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Smith Family Schedule").
4.  **URL:** Paste the Cozi iCal URL.
5.  **Color Mapping:** (Optional) Manually assign colors to specific family members if the feed doesn't support it natively.

**Why create Content Sources?**
You can create a "Full Family" source that shows everyone's events, and a "Kids' Schedule" source that filters for specific keywords or colors (if supported by advanced filtering).

## 3. Content Source Configuration (Styles)

Customize the display of your calendar.

*   **View Mode:** Agenda (List), Day, or Week view.
*   **Date Range:** Show today, tomorrow, or the next 7 days.
*   **Text Size:** Adjust for readability from a distance.

## 4. Add to Layout

1.  Open the **Layout Editor**.
2.  Add a **Calendar** area to the canvas.
3.  Select your saved source (e.g., "Smith Family Schedule").
4.  **Save** the layout.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Sync Delay:** Cozi feeds may take up to 15 minutes to update on external displays.
*   **Private URLs:** Ensure you are using the private iCal URL from Cozi settings, not a public sharing link.
