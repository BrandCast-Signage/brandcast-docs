# Google Slides Integration

Turn any Google Slides presentation into a digital sign. This is the easiest way to manage daily menus, announcements, and school updates.

## How it Works
BrandCast connects to your Google Account. When you update a slide deck in Google Drive, your screens update automatically (within ~15 minutes).

## Setup Guide

### 1. Connect Your Account
1.  Navigate to **Integrations** in the sidebar.
2.  Select **Google Slides**.
3.  Click **Connect Account** and sign in with your Google credentials.
    *   *Note:* You only need to do this once.

### 2. Create a Content Source
Think of a Content Source as a specific "Channel." You might have one for "Morning Menu" and another for "Staff News."

1.  Click **Create New Source**.
2.  **Source Name:** Give it a clear name (e.g., "Lunch Menu").
3.  **Select Presentation:** A file picker will appear. Choose your Google Slides file.
4.  **Refresh Interval:** How often BrandCast checks for edits. (Default: 15 mins).
5.  **Slide Duration:** How long to show each slide (Default: 10 seconds).
6.  Click **Save**.

### 3. Add to a Layout
Now that you have a source, put it on the screen.

1.  Go to **Layouts** and edit your target layout.
2.  Add a **Zone** (or double-click an existing one).
3.  Select **Integration** > **Google Slides**.
4.  Choose the source you created in Step 2.
5.  **Save** and **Publish**.

## Pro Tips

### Aspect Ratio Matters
*   **Standard TV:** Set your Google Slides page setup to **Widescreen 16:9** (File > Page Setup).
*   **Portrait TV:** Set page setup to **Custom > 1080 x 1920 pixels**.

### "Offline" Mode
BrandCast caches your slides. If the internet goes down, your screens will keep playing the last version of the presentation until connection is restored.

### Transitions
Animations *inside* a slide (like bullet points fading in) **do not** work on digital signage. BrandCast displays the final state of each slide. Use multiple slides to create build-up effects.
