# Weather Integration

Keep your customers and employees informed with local weather conditions and forecasts.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Create a Content Source
1.  Navigate to **Integrations** > **Weather**.
2.  Click **Create New Source**.
3.  **Name:** Give it a name (e.g., "Austin HQ Weather").
4.  **Location:** Enter City/State or Zip Code.
5.  **Units:** Select Fahrenheit or Celsius.
6.  Click **Save**.

### 2. Choose a Style
When adding weather to a layout, you can choose how much detail to show:

*   **Current (Minimal):** Just the temperature and an icon (e.g., ☀️ 72°F). Perfect for small footer zones.
*   **Forecast (Standard):** Current conditions plus a 3-day or 5-day forecast. Ideal for sidebars.
*   **Detailed (Full):** Includes humidity, wind speed, and "feels like" temperature. Best for main content zones.

### 3. Add to Layout
1.  Open the **Layout Editor**.
2.  Add a **Zone**.
3.  Select **Integration** > **Weather**.
4.  Choose your source ("Austin HQ Weather").
5.  **Save**.

## Common Use Cases
*   **Entryways:** Help visitors know if they need an umbrella before leaving.
*   **Break Rooms:** Help employees plan their commute.
*   **Digital Menu Boards:** Show the local temperature next to hot/cold drink specials.

## Troubleshooting
*   **Wrong Location?** Be specific. Instead of just "Springfield," use "Springfield, IL" to avoid ambiguity.
*   **Not Loading?** Ensure your screen has an active internet connection. Weather data is not cached like images; it needs a live connection to update.
