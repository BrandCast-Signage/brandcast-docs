# Google Business Reviews Integration

Display 5-star reviews and customer testimonials from your Google Business Profile.

## Overview

Google Business Reviews integration allows BrandCast users to display customer reviews from their Google Business Profile on digital signage displays. This is perfect for retail businesses, restaurants, service providers, and any business with a Google Business Profile looking to showcase positive customer feedback.

**Key Features:**
- **Auto-Sync:** New reviews are fetched automatically (every 6 hours).
- **Filtering:** Option to show only 4 or 5-star reviews.
- **Attribution:** Displays customer name and photo to prove authenticity.

## 1. Connect the Integration

1.  Navigate to **Integrations** > **Google Business Reviews**.
2.  Click **Connect Account**.
3.  Sign in with the Google Account that manages your Business Profile.
4.  **Important:** You must have "Manager" or "Owner" access to the business location.

## 2. Create a Content Source

A **Content Source** is a configured feed of reviews for a specific location.

1.  Navigate to **Integrations** > **Google Business Reviews**.
2.  Click **Create New Source**.
3.  **Select Location:** Choose the business location you want to display reviews for.
4.  **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Downtown Store Reviews").

**Why create Content Sources?**
If you manage multiple locations (e.g., "Downtown" and "Westside"), you create a separate source for each. You can then assign the "Downtown" reviews to the Downtown lobby screen, ensuring relevance.

## 3. Content Source Configuration (Styles)

Customize how reviews appear.

*   **Minimum Rating:** Filter to show only 4+ or 5-star reviews.
*   **Sort Order:** Newest first or Highest Rated.
*   **Display Style:**
    *   **Carousel:** Shows one review at a time, rotating every few seconds.
    *   **Grid:** Shows multiple reviews at once.
    *   **List:** Vertical scrolling list.
*   **Privacy:** Option to hide reviewer last names or photos.

## 4. Add to Layout

1.  Open the **Layout Editor**.
2.  Add a **Reviews** area to the canvas.
3.  Select your saved source (e.g., "Downtown Store Reviews").
4.  **Save** the layout.

## Troubleshooting

*   **No Reviews Showing:** Ensure your Google account has the correct permissions. Also, check if you have enough reviews meeting your "Minimum Rating" filter.
*   **Updates Delayed:** Google limits review fetching to once every 6 hours to prevent API quotas from being exceeded.
