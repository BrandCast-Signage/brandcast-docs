# Canva Integration

Import your Canva designs directly into your BrandCast Media Library.

## Overview

The Canva integration streamlines the process of getting your marketing materials onto your screens. Instead of downloading files and re-uploading them, you can browse your Canva projects from within BrandCast and import them as high-quality assets.

**Key Features:**
- **Direct Import:** Fetch designs without leaving the dashboard.
- **High Quality:** Imports designs as optimized PNGs for digital signage.
- **Library Integration:** Imported assets live in your Media Library, ready for any layout.

**Important Note:** This is a **Library Import** integration. It fetches a snapshot of your design at the time of import. It does **not** create a live link. If you change the design in Canva, you must re-import it to update the screen.

## 1. Connect the Integration

1.  Navigate to **Integrations** > **Canva**.
2.  Click **Connect Account**.
3.  Authorize BrandCast to access your Canva designs.

## 2. Import Designs (Create Content)

Instead of creating a "Content Source" that streams data, you use this integration to populate your **Media Library**.

1.  Navigate to **Library** > **Import**.
2.  Select **Canva**.
3.  Browse your Canva folders and designs.
4.  Select the design(s) you want to use.
5.  Click **Import**.

**Organization:**
Imported designs are automatically tagged with "Canva" for easy searching. You can add your own tags (e.g., "Summer Sale", "Menu") during import.

## 3. Use in Layouts

Once imported, Canva designs are treated just like any other image or video in your library.

1.  Open the **Layout Editor**.
2.  Add an **Image** area to the canvas.
3.  Select **Library** as the source.
4.  Choose your imported Canva design.
5.  **Save** the layout.

**Reusability:**
Because the design is now a standard library asset, you can use it in multiple layouts, schedule it in a playlist, or assign it to specific displays without re-connecting to Canva.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Design Not Updating:** Remember, this is not a live link. If you edit the design in Canva, go to **Library** > **Import** > **Canva** and import the design again to overwrite the old version.
*   **Wrong Dimensions:** For best results, set your Canva design dimensions to **1920x1080 px** (or the resolution of your screens) before importing.
