# Pricing & Plans

:::warning BETA Pricing
BrandCast is currently in beta. Pricing is subject to change as we refine our product based on customer feedback. Early adopters will be notified of any pricing changes with 30 days notice.
:::

Simple, transparent pricing that scales with your business. Pay only for the displays you use.

## How BrandCast Pricing Works

BrandCast uses **pay-per-display pricing** with automatic volume discounts. The more displays you add, the less you pay per display.

### Pricing Tiers

| Displays | Price Per Display | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **1-5 displays** | $8/display | $8 - $40/month |
| **6-10 displays** | $7/display | $42 - $70/month |
| **11-25 displays** | $6/display | $66 - $150/month |
| **26+ displays** | $5/display | $130+/month |

### Examples

- **Small store** (2 displays): 2 × $8 = **$16/month**
- **Growing business** (8 displays): 8 × $7 = **$56/month**
- **Regional chain** (20 displays): 20 × $6 = **$120/month**
- **Large franchise** (50 displays): 50 × $5 = **$250/month**

## What's Included

### Every Account Includes:

- **Unlimited content items** - No limits on images, videos, or content
- **All integrations** - Google Workspace, Canva, weather, calendars, and more
- **Unlimited team members** - Add as many users as you need
- **Unlimited stores** - Manage multiple locations at no extra cost
- **2GB storage per display** - Scales automatically as you add displays
- **Email support** - Get help when you need it
- **Training resources** - Video tutorials and documentation

### Storage

- **Included:** 2GB per display (10 displays = 20GB total)
- **Overage:** $1/GB per month for additional storage

## Volume Discounts Explained

### Retroactive Pricing

When you cross into a new pricing tier, **ALL your displays** get the lower price, not just the new ones.

**Example:**
- You have 5 displays at $8 each = $40/month
- You add a 6th display
- ALL 6 displays now cost $7 each = $42/month (not $40 + $7 = $47)

This means the more you grow, the more you save.

## Features Unlock as You Grow

Certain premium features unlock automatically based on your display count:

| Feature | Unlocks At |
|---------|-----------|
| **Advanced Templates** | 3+ displays |
| **Real-Time Analytics** | 5+ displays |
| **Bulk Operations** | 10+ displays |
| **Developer API Access** | 25+ displays |

No need to change plans - features unlock automatically when you add displays.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does billing work when I add displays mid-month?**
You're charged a pro-rated amount for the days remaining in your billing cycle. For example, if you add a display halfway through the month, you only pay for half the month.

**What happens when I remove displays?**
You receive a pro-rated credit that applies to your next bill. No wasted money.

**Can I change how many displays I have anytime?**
Yes! Add or remove displays whenever you want. Billing adjusts automatically.

**Is there a minimum number of displays?**
No minimum. You can start with just 1 display.

**What if I need to pause my business seasonally?**
Deactivate all your displays during your off-season. You'll only pay for storage (if any). Reactivate when you're ready to reopen.

**Do you offer non-profit discounts?**
Yes, we offer 20% off for qualified 501(c)(3) organizations. Contact us for verification.

**Can I get a refund if I cancel?**
We don't offer refunds for the current billing period, but you can use BrandCast until the end of your paid period. Your card won't be charged again.

**What happens if I go over my storage limit?**
You'll be charged $1/GB per month for any storage over your included amount (2GB per display). You can see your storage usage in real-time in your dashboard.

## Pricing Philosophy

We believe pricing should be:
- **Simple** - No complicated tiers or hidden fees
- **Fair** - Pay for what you use, nothing more
- **Transparent** - See exactly what you'll pay before you commit
- **Scalable** - Pricing that grows with you, not against you

As a small, bootstrapped team, we're focused on building a sustainable business that serves our customers well. Your feedback on pricing is welcome as we refine our model.
