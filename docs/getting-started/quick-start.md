# Quick Start Guide

Get your first BrandCast display live in under 5 minutes. This guide covers the "Happy Path"—the fastest way to get content from your laptop to your screen.

## Prerequisites
*   A **BrandCast Account** (Log in at [app.brandcast.app](https://app.brandcast.app)).
*   A **Screen** (TV, Tablet, or Monitor) connected to the internet.
*   One **Image or Video** file to display.

## Step 1: Pair Your Screen
BrandCast uses a "Code Pairing" system. The screen generates a code, and you enter it into your dashboard.

1.  **On your TV/Screen:**
    *   Open the BrandCast App (or browser).
    *   Wait for the **Pairing Code** to appear (e.g., `BC-8X92`).
2.  **On your Laptop (Dashboard):**
    *   Navigate to **Displays** > **Pair New Display**.
    *   **Pairing Code:** Enter the code shown on your TV.
    *   **Display Name:** Give it a name (e.g., "Lobby TV").
    *   Click **Pair Display**.

Your TV should instantly update to show a "Ready" or "Default" screen. It is now connected to your account.

## Step 2: Use the Layout Wizard (Fastest Way)
The fastest way to get content on screen is using the **Layout Wizard**. It handles uploading, layout creation, and assignment in one flow.

1.  Navigate to **Layouts** in the sidebar.
2.  Click the **+ Add Layout** button.
3.  **The Wizard** will launch automatically.
4.  **Upload Content:**
    *   Select **Upload File**.
    *   Choose your image or video.
    *   *Alternative:* You can also select "Google Slides" here if you have a presentation ready.
5.  **Review:** The Wizard will automatically create a "Full Screen" layout for your content.
6.  Click **Save & Finish**.

## Step 3: Publish to Your Screen
Now that you have a Layout, send it to your paired screen.

1.  Navigate to **Displays**.
2.  Click on the display you paired in Step 1.
3.  Find the **Active Layout** section.
4.  Select your new Layout from the dropdown.
5.  Click **Update**.

**Look at your TV!** Within 10-30 seconds, your content will appear.
