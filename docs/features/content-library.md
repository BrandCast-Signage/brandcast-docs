# Content Library

The Content Library is the central repository for everything you show on your screens. It is divided into three main categories: **Media Files**, **Integrations**, and **Quick Content**.

## 1. Media Files (Uploaded Content)
This is where you store your company's own assets.
*   **Images:** Supports JPG, PNG, and GIF. 
*   **Videos:** Supports MP4 and MOV (H.264).
*   **Smart Crop (Orientation):** When you upload an image, BrandCast automatically creates Portrait, Landscape, and Square variants. This ensures your logo looks perfect whether it's on a vertical tablet or a widescreen TV.
*   **Deduplication:** To save storage space, the system automatically detects if you've uploaded the same file twice and uses the existing version.

## 2. Integrations (Dynamic Content)
Integrations pull live data from external services so your screens stay fresh without manual updates.
*   **Google Slides:** The most popular way to manage menus and announcements. Just update your slide deck, and the screens update automatically.
*   **Weather & Clocks:** Real-time local data based on your store's location.
*   **Google Photos:** Sync a specific album to turn your display into a digital photo frame.
*   **Dad Jokes:** A built-in fun feed to keep customers or employees smiling.

## 3. Quick Content (Direct Mode)
Sometimes you don't need a file or a feed—you just need to type a message. 
*   In the **Layout Editor**, you can set a zone to **Quick Content** mode.
*   Type your text directly into the dashboard (e.g., "Wet Floor" or "Welcome Smith Family").
*   Format the font and color instantly.

## Content Sources: The "Connector"
In BrandCast, you don't assign a "File" to a "Screen." You assign a **Content Source**.

Think of a Content Source as a **saved configuration**. 
*   *Example:* Instead of just "Weather," you create a Content Source named "Lobby Weather" set to "Richmond, VA" with "Fahrenheit" units. You can then use this specific "Lobby Weather" source on 50 different layouts.

## Shared vs. Store-Specific
*   **Shared Content:** Assets uploaded by a Brand Manager that are available to all locations (e.g., National Promos, Brand Logos).
*   **Store-Specific:** Content uploaded by a Local Manager for their specific screen (e.g., "Store Manager of the Month").

## Best Practices
*   **Tag Everything:** Use tags like `Winter2025` or `LunchMenu` to find content quickly when building layouts.
*   **Monitor Quotas:** Videos take up significantly more space than images. Use the **Library Statistics** panel to keep an eye on your storage limits.
*   **High Contrast:** Digital signage is often viewed from a distance. Use bold colors and large images for maximum impact.
