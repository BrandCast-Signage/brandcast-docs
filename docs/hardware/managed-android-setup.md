# Managed Android Setup

Managed devices are the easiest way to deploy BrandCast. They arrive pre-configured, meaning you can skip the technical setup and focus on content.

## What's in the Box?
*   **The Device:** Either a BrandCast Tablet (10" or 15") or a BrandCast HDMI Stick.
*   **Power Supply:** Always use the included power adapter. TV USB ports often don't provide enough power.
*   **Mounting Hardware:** (If purchased) VESA mount or adhesive strips.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Installation
*   **Tablet:** Plug in the power cable. If mounting to a wall, ensure the power cable has a path to an outlet.
*   **HDMI Stick:** Plug the stick into your TV's HDMI port. **Crucial:** Connect the USB power cable to a wall outlet, not the TV's USB port.

### 2. Connect to Internet
1.  Turn on the device.
2.  It will boot directly into the BrandCast setup screen.
3.  Tap **Configure Network** to connect to your Wi-Fi (or plug in an Ethernet cable).

### 3. Verification
Once connected, the device will display a **Pairing Code**.
*   *Note:* If you purchased the device through your account, it may already be paired. In that case, it will immediately start downloading your default content.

### 4. Assign Content
1.  Log in to your BrandCast Dashboard.
2.  Navigate to **Displays**.
3.  Find your new device (it might be named "New Managed Device" or similar).
4.  Rename it (e.g., "Lobby Screen") and assign a Layout or Playlist.

## Remote Management Features
Because this is a managed device, you have extra controls in the Dashboard:
*   **Reboot Device:** Restart the hardware remotely if it acts up.
*   **Update App:** Push the latest software version without touching the screen.
*   **Screen Capture:** See exactly what is on the screen right now.
