# Hardware Strategy

BrandCast is designed to be flexible. We offer a **Managed Solution** for those who want a "plug-and-play" experience, and a **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** path for those who want to use existing hardware.

## 1. Managed Android (Recommended)
This is the "Gold Standard" for enterprise reliability.
*   **What is it?** A dedicated Android Tablet or HDMI Stick purchased directly from BrandCast.
*   **Why use it?**
    *   **Zero Setup:** Ships pre-paired to your account.
    *   **Remote Management:** We can remotely reboot, update, and troubleshoot the device.
    *   **Kiosk Mode:** The app is locked to the screen; no one can exit it.
    *   **Warranty:** Includes a 12-month replacement warranty.

## 2. BYOD Android
Turn any modern Android device into a digital sign.
*   **Supported Devices:** Any tablet, TV, or media player running **Android 10+**.
*   **App Installation:** Download the BrandCast Player from the Google Play Store (or sideload our APK).
*   **Trade-offs:** You are responsible for OS updates, device security, and keeping the app running (Kiosk Mode requires manual configuration).

## 3. Chrome / PWA (Web Player)
The universal fallback for any screen with a browser.
*   **How to access:** Navigate to `player.brandcast.app` on *any* modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari).
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Laptops:** Quickly test a layout on your desk.
    *   **Smart TVs:** Use the TV's built-in web browser (Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS).
    *   **Desktops:** Turn a spare PC into a dashboard.
*   **Limitations:** Browsers may show address bars, go to sleep, or crash after long periods. It lacks the native "Reboot" capabilities of the Android app.
