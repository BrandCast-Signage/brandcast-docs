# Web Player (PWA) Setup

The Web Player is the most versatile way to view BrandCast content. It turns any device with a browser into a digital sign.

## When to use it?
*   **Testing:** Preview a layout on your laptop before publishing.
*   **Smart TVs:** Samsung (Tizen) and LG (WebOS) TVs often have good web browsers but no Android app store.
*   **Old Hardware:** Repurpose an old Windows PC or Mac Mini.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Launch the Player
1.  Open your browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox).
2.  Navigate to **[player.brandcast.app](https://player.brandcast.app)**.
3.  The browser will load the player and display a **Pairing Code**.

### 2. Full Screen Mode
To hide the address bar and tabs:
*   **Windows/Linux:** Press `F11`.
*   **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Ctrl + F`.
*   **Smart TVs:** Usually automatic, or look for a "Full Screen" button in the browser menu.

### 3. Pair the Display
1.  Log in to your Dashboard.
2.  Go to **Displays > Pair New Display**.
3.  Enter the code shown in the browser.

## Limitations
*   **No Remote Reboot:** We cannot restart your computer remotely.
*   **Sleep Mode:** You must manually configure your OS power settings to "Never Sleep."
*   **Address Bar:** On some devices (like iPads), the address bar may reappear if the screen is touched.

## "Install" as App (PWA)
For a better experience, you can "install" the website as an app:
1.  **Chrome/Edge:** Click the "Install" icon (monitor with a down arrow) in the right side of the address bar.
2.  **Safari (iPad):** Tap the "Share" button > "Add to Home Screen."
This removes the browser chrome and gives you a dedicated icon.
