# Amazon Fire Tablet Setup

Amazon Fire Tablets are the most affordable way to get started with BrandCast. They are reliable, available everywhere, and cost a fraction of commercial hardware.

## Supported Models
We support any Fire Tablet running **Fire OS 7.0 or newer**.
*   **Fire HD 8** (2018 or newer)
*   **Fire HD 10** (2017 or newer)
*   **Fire Max 11**

:::warning Important
The cheaper **Fire 7** is **NOT recommended** due to its low screen resolution and slow processor, though it is technically compatible.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Prepare the Tablet
1.  **Factory Reset:** If this is an old tablet, we recommend a factory reset to clear out junk.
2.  **Amazon Account:** Sign in with an Amazon account. You can use a dedicated business account to keep it separate from your personal shopping.
3.  **Disable Sleep:** Go to **Settings** > **Display** > **Display Sleep** and set it to **Never** (or the maximum allowed). *Note: Fire OS sometimes resets this; we'll fix it in the next step.*

### Step 2: Install the BrandCast Player
Since BrandCast is a business tool, it's not in the consumer Amazon Appstore. You must "sideload" it.

1.  Open the **Silk Browser** on the tablet.
2.  Go to `https://brandcast.app/download`.
3.  Tap the **Download for Fire OS** button.
4.  Open the downloaded file. You will see a security warning.
5.  Tap **Settings** on the warning > Toggle **Allow from this source** ON.
6.  Go back and tap **Install**.

### Step 3: Register the Device
1.  Open the **BrandCast App**.
2.  Grant the requested permissions (Storage/Overlay).
3.  A **Pairing Code** will appear (e.g., `BC-K9L2`).
4.  Log in to your BrandCast Dashboard on your computer.
5.  Go to **Displays** > **Pair New Display** and enter the code.

### Step 4: Enable Kiosk Mode (Optional but Recommended)
BrandCast has a built-in Kiosk Mode that prevents users (or stray taps) from exiting the app.

1.  In the BrandCast App on the tablet, tap the **Gear Icon** (Settings) in the corner.
2.  Scroll down to **Kiosk Mode**.
3.  Tap **Enable Kiosk Mode**.
4.  Follow the prompts to grant **Accessibility Permissions** (this is required for the app to block the "Home" button).

## Mounting Tips
*   **Power:** Ensure you mount the tablet near an outlet. Even with the screen off, digital signage drains batteries quickly. Always keep it plugged in.
*   **Orientation:** Fire Tablets work great in both Portrait and Landscape. BrandCast will auto-rotate to match.
*   **Mounts:** We recommend simple "damage-free" adhesive strips (like 3M Command Strips) for lightweight mounting on glass or drywall.
