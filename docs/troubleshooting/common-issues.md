# Common Issues & Triage

If something isn't working as expected, follow this 3-step triage before contacting support.

## 🩺 The 3-Step Triage

### 1. Check the Dashboard Status
Look at the **Displays** list in your dashboard.
*   **Green Dot:** The screen is connected to the internet and talking to our servers.
*   **Red Dot:** The screen is offline. Check its Wi-Fi connection.

### 2. Verify Content Assignment
Click on your display in the dashboard.
*   Is an **Active Layout** or **Playlist** assigned?
*   If the assignment is "None," the screen will show a default "Ready" message.

### 3. Force a Refresh
Digital signage players sometimes cache old data.
*   **On your computer:** Refresh the dashboard page.
*   **On the display:** Unplug the power and plug it back in, or use the **Reboot** command from the dashboard (if supported by your hardware).

## 🛠️ Problem / Solution Guide

### Pairing Issues

| If you see... | Try this... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Invalid Code"** | Double-check the code. It is valid for 15 minutes. If it has been longer, refresh the TV to get a new code. |
| **"Code Expired"** | Refresh the browser or app on the TV. Enter the new code in the dashboard immediately. |
| **QR Code won't scan** | Ensure the TV isn't in a high-glare area. You can always type the 6-character code manually instead. |

### Content Issues

| If you see... | Try this... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Black Screen** | Verify the TV is on and set to the correct HDMI input. Check the Dashboard to see if the display is "Online." |
| **Old Content Playing** | You likely have a **Playlist** assigned that includes old layouts. Go to **Playlists** and remove the outdated items. |
| **"Error Loading Integration"** | This usually means an integration (like Google Slides) has lost its authorization. Go to **Integrations** and re-link your account. |
| **Images look blurry** | Check your **Layout Resolution**. If you are using a 4K TV but a 720p Layout, images will appear pixelated. |

### Performance & Connectivity

| If you see... | Try this... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Videos are stuttering** | Your Wi-Fi may be weak. Try connecting the display via **Ethernet** or reducing the video file size. |
| **Weather/Clock is wrong** | Check the **Timezone** setting in your Store Profile. All time-based content relies on the Store's location settings. |
| **Dashboard is slow** | Clear your browser cache or try an Incognito/Private window. Ensure you aren't uploading multiple large videos at once. |
