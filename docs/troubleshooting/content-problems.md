1. Go to **Content Sources**
2. Find the content source
3. Verify **Is Active** toggle is ON
4. If OFF, enable and save

**Content Source Deleted:**

- Create new source if needed
- Reassign to layout

---

#### Step 2: Confirm Layout Assignment

**Content Must Be in Layout:**
1. Go to **Layouts** â†’ Click layout
2. Open **Layout Editor**
3. Verify content area exists on canvas
4. Check content source is assigned to area
5. Save if changes made

**No Content Area:**

- Publish layout

---

#### Step 3: Check Display Assignment

**Display Must Have Layout:**

---

#### Step 4: Verify Content Source Configuration

**Content Type-Specific Checks:**

**For LIBRARY Content (Images/Videos):**
- Media file still exists in library?
- Media file active (not archived)?
- File format supported?

**For INTEGRATION Content (RSS, Weather, etc.):**
- Integration connected and authorized?
- API credentials valid?
- No rate limit exceeded?
- Last fetch successful?

**For TEXT Content:**
- Text field not empty?
- Text color not same as background?

2. Or clear browser cache completely
3. Content should reappear

**Refresh Content Source:**
1. Edit content source
