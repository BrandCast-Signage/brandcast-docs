## Display Registration

### Display Won't Register

**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid registration code" error
- "Registration failed" message
- Code accepted but display doesn't connect
- Display stays on registration screen

**Common Causes and Solutions:**

#### 1. Registration Code Issues

**Expired Code:**
- Codes expire after 24 hours
- Check **Last Generated** timestamp in display settings
- Generate new code if expired

**How to Generate New Code:**
1. Go to **Displays**
2. Click on display name
3. Click **Generate New Registration Code**
4. Note the 6-character code
5. Use new code on display device

**Code Already Used:**
- Each code can only be used once
- If display was previously registered, you need a new code
- Deregister the display first if needed

**Incorrect Code Entered:**
- Codes are case-sensitive
- Verify: ABC123 â‰  abc123
- Check for similar-looking characters:
  - 0 (zero) vs O (letter O)
  - 1 (one) vs I (letter I) vs l (lowercase L)
- Re-enter code carefully

---

#### 2. Display Configuration

**Display Not Active:**
1. Go to **Displays** in dashboard
